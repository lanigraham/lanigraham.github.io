## Applications programming

Created a GUI music player using Java AWT/SWING that could read in text files into albums and play music, as well as create playlists and show album works. We used the software development life cycle to create the project, including creating UML and implementing software testing. Produced a report following the software development cycle and a user manual.

## Database manipulation

Used SQL and PostgreSQL to create and manipulate a database. We used Java and JDBC to interact with the database during the practical and were asked to perform a number of tasks. Including importing the database form a text file, and exporting results to a text file.

## Internet and multimedia techniques

We were tasked to create a website for a hotel company, the website needed to let users add and remove bookings, as well as have a separate site for staff members about if the room had been cleaned or not. We had to create a backend database for the site to hold the booking information, as well as the front end for the users. We used UML and competitor analysis to design and fulfil the requirements of the site. We worked in teams for this project.

## Data Mining

We followed the KDD process and mined of a Forest Cover Type dataset which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/data). We used SPSS modeler and Weka to explore the database and produced a technical report of our findings.


## Information Visualisation

Collected data information on tuberculosis world wide and presented it by creating a webpage and using Highcharts.js to an audience not from a scientific background in a comprehensible way.
