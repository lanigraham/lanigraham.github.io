---

## Introduction

Currently creating a readability iOS application using Objective C to learn the language. The application changes the colour of polysyllable words and will calculate the readability of the text using a number of readability formulas.

<br/>
![Highlighted text]({{ "/assets/images/text_highlight.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="center-image blackBorder z-depth-3"}
<br/>
<br/>

The application can currently detect multi-syllable words and calculate the SMOG value of the text. It can also show variables including the number of words, the number of sentences, average number of words per sentence, average number of letters per word and other useful text analysis variables.


<br/>
![Statistical view]({{ "/assets/images/stats_view.png" | absolute_url }}){:class="center-image blackBorder z-depth-3"}
<br/>
<br/>

Later the application will lead to a statistical overview which will graphically show these variables in the application.
