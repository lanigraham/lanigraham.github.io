blerb: <br/> Created an extension on the chrome store that allows the use of a screen ruler
---

## Introduction

Based on my dissertation research there were a number of claims that screen rulers could help eye tracking in dyslexic individuals. For example, screen rulers are included in the [ClaroRead][claroread] software made for individuals with learning difficulties and other disabilities recommended by the university. However, access to the software would only be on library computers or if you had a known diagnosis. Otherwise the software is not affordable for student, or low-income individuals.

As so much information is now displayed on the Web, and Google is one of the primary search engines used around the world (some 1.17 billion people), it seemed suitable to develop a screen ruler as a chrome extension. Additionally, a simple search of the chrome extensions showed no similar extension representing a screen ruler, though text and background colour editing extensions did already exists which are other factors that can aid an individual with reading difficulties.

The chrome extension has a simple display using bootstrap. There are a few options of different colours as some companies claim that colour is personal and can affect the ability of an individual to read coherently. Although there are few studies to back this evidence. Size and opacity of the ruler is also an option, where individuals with sight difficulties might increase text size are require a larger ruler.

The decision to use "larger" and "smaller" buttons to increment the size instead of specifying values was to improve usability.
