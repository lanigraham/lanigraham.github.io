INTRODUCTION:

This package contains the Ruby bindings for itex2MML. 
It converts itex, a dialect of LaTeX, to MathML.
A summary of the LaTeX syntax supported in itex can be found at

The source repository for the itex2MML project may be found at

The Ruby module provides four public methods

       require 'itextomml'
       itex =  Itex2MML::Parser.new

       itex.html_filter(a_string)
               converts all itex equations in a_string to MathML, passing the
               rest of a_string unmodified. Returns the converted string. 

       itex.filter(a_string)
               converts all itex equations in a_string to MathML. Returns just
               the MathML equation(s), as a string.

       itex.inline_filter(a_string)
               treats a_string as an inline equation (automatically supplies
               the surrounding $...$, so you don't have to) and converts it
               MathML. Returns the MathML inline equation, as a string.

       itex.block_filter(a_string)
               treats a_string as a block equation (automatically supplies
               the surrounding $$...$$, so you don't have to) and converts it
               MathML. Returns the MathML block equation, as a string.
